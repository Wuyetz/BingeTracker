# BingeTracker
Movie binge tracker in MVC ASP.NET

Using movie dataset available publicly for learning purposes on https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ I created this app that lets you browse list of movies with 
imdb properties such as genres, release years etc. and add/remove them to/from your collection, add notes, rate them..

For now I only added movies with most votes on Imdb to speed up the process, but all movies released till today can easily be added if neccessary. 

This is the project I am presently working on, using it to learn about MVC and at current time not yet completely done and polished.
